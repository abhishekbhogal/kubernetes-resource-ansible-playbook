This YAML file contains a playbook that can be used to increase the resources for Kubernetes pods. The playbook first gets the current pod information, then increases the CPU and memory limits for the pods, and finally checks the pod status and waits for the pods to be ready.

This playbook can be used to improve the performance and reliability of Kubernetes pods.

Here are some additional details that you could add to the description:

The playbook uses the Ansible k8s module to interact with Kubernetes.
The playbook can be used to increase the resources for pods in any namespace.
The playbook can be used to increase the CPU and memory limits for individual pods or for all pods in a namespace.
The playbook can be used to check the status of pods and wait for them to be ready.
